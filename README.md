# Linux App Store
Is a universal app store for Linux.

View the project live [here](https://nshusa.github.io/linux-app-store/)

### The Problem
* Flatpak, Snap and AppImage have their own app store which can only browse their own format.
    * Flatpak has [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/home)
    * Snap has [SnapCraft](https://snapcraft.io/store)
    * AppImage has [AppImageHub](https://appimage.github.io/apps/)
* [Gnome Software Center](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software)
    * Outdated UI
    * Slow & Buggy
    * Built on GTK (Works best on Gnome desktops)
    * Focuses on Gnome apps
    
### Goal
* Browse and install Flatpaks, Snaps, and AppImages without going to these individual websites. 
* Modern, fast and user-friendly
* No command-line
