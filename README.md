Is a universal app store for Linux. The focus of the Linux App Store is to make Linux easier to use by making applications easier to find and install. The Linux App Store does not favor one distrobution over another. The Linux App Store also does not favor one package format over another.. Our goal is simply to make the software you use more accessible to you. See [linuxappstore.io](https://linuxappstore.io/)

### The Problem
Flatpak, Snap and AppImage have their own app store which can only browse their own format.
* Flatpak: [FlatHub](https://flathub.org/home)
* Snap: [Snapcraft](https://snapcraft.io/store)
* AppImage: [AppImageHub](https://appimage.github.io/apps/)

The Linux App Store will act as the middle-man and give you access to all of them from a single interface.

Other software centers such as [Gnome Software Center](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Software)
* Built on GTK (Works best on Gnome desktops)
* Focuses on Gnome apps
* Slow and buggy
* Development is slow
* Outdated UI

The Linux App Store is not build on GTK, instead it's built on modern web technologies.

### Goal
* Browse and install Flatpaks, Snaps, and AppImages without going to these individual websites. 
* Modern, fast and user-friendly
* No command-line

### F.A.Q
**Q: Why App Store instead of Software Center?**
A: Software centers have all types of software in them. They have server, cloud, desktop etc.. Our focus will be aimed towards desktop applications although our data may not only have desktop apps. Linux App Store is aimed towards the non-technical user or people who want a GUI to find/install programs.

**Q: Will I be able to install software?**
A: In the future, yes.

**Q: Will there ever be any paid features?**
A: No this will be 100% free. If you enjoy what we do, donations are always appreciated.

**Q: Will you ever add deb or rpm packages?**
A: In the future possibly, not the main focus right now though.

**Q: Why another Software Center/App Store?**
A: We want to make an App Store that has no bias towards a specific distro, desktop environment or package format. We also want to make an App store that just works.

### Roadmap
* ~~Web version~~
* ~~Browser AppImage, Flatpak, Snap~~
* Desktop version
* Install AppImage, Flatpak and Snap
